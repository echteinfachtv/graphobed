# graphobed #

**graphobed** is a jquery script that finds equations on your website, 
parses them and embeds the according graphs below the formula as HTML5 canvas. 
To let the script find your equations, enclose them in `*# equation #*`

Embedded Graphs can be changed later on, using the created input field.
This script relies on: jquery, easeljs and math.js
